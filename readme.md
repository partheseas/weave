## Overview

Weave is a very unique server made for Node.js. It takes a different approach to resolving
file locations and gives you great control over the behavior of the server.

Weave runs in Node along side your own code that configures and controls it.

## Installation

Just download a tarball and throw it into a node_modules folder somewhere. You should be good to go.

**I will be publishing weave in the NPM directory eventually. I just want to get a fully functioning product ready first.**

## Features
- Extensive and powerful customization
- Unique and versatile path resolving
- Easy access to server side scripting in any language
- Quick and easy to setup WebSocket implementation


### Coming soon...
- An easy to use and robust command line interface
- A simple web interface to control remotely or locally monitor internal data
- SPDY & HTTP 2.0 support eventually maybe
